# mern_todo_list
MongoDB Express React Node / M.E.R.N



A simple todo-list project made to learn **MERN** stack, using:

* MongoDB, a data base in NoSQL 

* Express.js and Node.js, for the Back End
* React.js for the Front End



The project use web services, meaning that the Front et Back run on different server, so you have to run both of them separately. 

Both projects can be launch with a **npm start** (after a **npm install** to install dependencies)

The Back end run on port 4000, while Front end run on port 3000.



Note that the Back end need to be connected to an existing Database (either running locally or remotely).



What you need to run the project :

* Back/Front : **node** and **npm** on your computer
* Back: **nodemon** (to rerun automatically the back after each modification on a file)
